# AESTube
This is a PoC using youtube audio to encrypt text/files. It uses AES-256.
How it's done:
1. Download MP4 audio stream from a YouTube link.
2. MP4 audio is converted to WAV.
3. WAV is processed through FFT to extract audio frequencies.
4. Frequencies are mapped to musical notes.
5. These notes are used as the passphrase for AES encryption.
6. That's all folks ðŸ˜Ž

In addition to this, I created some audio splitting mechanism that allows you to trim it, improving the security.
## Installation (Read carefully. Some tweaks are needed)
Assure that you have python3 installed on your system.
```sh
#Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/nicomda/AESTube.git

#Install if not installed
pip3 install virtualenv

#Creating virtualenv
python3 -m venv AESTube

#Activating venv
source ./bin/activate

#Installing required libraries in the virtual enviroment (FFMpeg, pyaudio...)
cd AESTube
sudo chmod +x dependencies-installer.sh
./dependencies-installer.sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
#Must update pytube as shown to get it working
pip3 install git+https://github.com/nficano/pytube.git --upgrade
```
## Quick Start
```bash
#To encrypt text: 
./AESTube.py -e -t 'text_to_encrypt' -l 'YoutubeLink' -s 'start_seconds' 'end_seconds'

#To decrypt files: 
./AESTube.py -e -t 'filepath' -l 'YoutubeLink' -s 'start_seconds' 'end_seconds'
```
